So, you are an international student, you want to drive in Pittsburgh, or you just want another form of ID. However, you're too lazy to read the PennDOT website, or you just feel like it's too confusing for you. Anyways, welcome! Hopefully this article kinda clears up the process for you!

## Step 1: Getting an SSN (or not)

In order to first apply for a permit, you either need an SSN or an SSN denial letter. The denial letter is basically a letter to request to prove to the DMV that you can't get an SSN.  There is an entire guide [here](https://www.dmv.pa.gov/Driver-Services/Driver-Licensing/Pages/Customers-Who-Do-Not-Have-a-Social-Security-Card.aspx) to applying for the denial letter, but honestly, if you aren't in a rush, I would just recommend getting an SSN, since it will just make life a lot easier for you in the future. In fact I also wrote another [article](https://jerick-1380.github.io/How-to-Get-an-SSN-as-an-International-Student-at-CMU/) about getting an SSN if you are interested.


## Step 2: Completing the DL-180

Because I'm so nice, I've linked the [form](https://www.dot.state.pa.us/Public/DVSPubsForms/BDL/BDL%20Form/DL-180.pdf) right here. You should be able to complete most of page 1 by yourself. In order to complete page 2, you actually need a physician. I know the CMU UHS offers such a service, and I think the wait isn't that long. Of course, if you want somewhere off-campus and doesn't require a long reservation, try [ihealth](https://ihealth.clinic/drivers-physical/), which is where I did the test. Literally all they do is make sure you can actually see and that you don't have any huge issues.

## Step 3: Getting 2 Proofs of Residency

The types of proof of residency are listed on the 3rd page of the DL-180. Literally, if you have a package delivered to your doorstep, just rip of the address label, and that's one proof of residency done. For the second, if you live off-campus, it should be simple enough, since any bill should be fine. If you live on-campus, ask your RA or CA, and they should be able to get you some proof that you are living on campus (unless the housing portal updated and you can get one online directly).

## Step 4: Prepare for the Knowledge Test

Literally Google "PennDot Knowledge Test" and like 100 results will come up. Just keep doing them until you feel like you can get everything right most of the time. The benchmark is like a 15/17, so it really shouldn't take you that long. As a reference, I spent around 2-3 days preparing for this knowledge test. 科目一 probably took me a month :).


## Step 5: Go to the PennDOT Driver License Center

You should have these things in your hand:

1) Your passport
2) Your F-1
3) Your SSN/SSN Denial Letter
4) Your DL-180 fully completed
5) 2 Proofs of Residency

and you should be good to go! Go to the PennDOT Driver License Center (708 Smithfield St, the 61s and 71s take you there), and then wait in line. They will look at your documents, give you a quick eye test, make you take the test, take your photo, and then you will get your permit on the spot!

## Step 6: Learn to Drive

If you already know how to drive, you can skip this step. I mean, it's still good to practice once or twice, since the roads in Pittsburgh are pretty hilly. If you don't know how to drive, HIGHLY reccomend going to a driving school. You could learn from your friend(s), but like, the driving schools know what techniques to use in order to pass. I went to the [Cindy Cohen Driving School] (https://drivingbuythebest.com/) cause I got to take 3 lessons, and then directly take the test. It's a bit expensive, a super long wait for each lesson, but I thought it was pretty worth it.

## Step 7: Take the Driving Test

If you went to a driving school, then there's a pretty high chance they offer a test as well. Cindy Cohen Driving School offered a test that was pretty easy to pass. Of course, you could also directly register for a driving test on [PennDot](https://www.dot3e.penndot.gov/exam_scheduling/eslogin.jsp#top?20230711015804948=20230711015804948). Just make sure that you bring your permit to the test. Other than that, it's pretty self explanatory. They will sign your permit so you have a temporary license for like 6 months. Then, the actual license will be mailed to you in around 2 weeks or so.

## Step 8: CELEBRATE

Be happy cause you spent all that time getting a driver's license! It wasn't easy, but you did it! Also, if you're from China, all you need is your US license and then take the 科目一 and then you can get your Chinese license as well!

Anyways, that's all from me. Good luck!!!
